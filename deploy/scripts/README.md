# Scripts
The scripts in this directory are for developers to test deployments from their local machines.  As a 
developer, you may need to change the --profile value in the scripts to use a profile that you have 
created on your machine.  If you choose to deploy to a different region you need to change the value
of --region in the commands in the scripts.

These scripts are not used in the deployment of the pipeline when the pipeline is running in AWS 
CodePipeline.
